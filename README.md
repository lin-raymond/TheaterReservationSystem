# Theater Reservation System

Manages user reservations for a theater show.

The various pdf's in the root folder contain the design information about the reservation system itself.

In the data folder, there are two sample files. The "user.txt" file shows samples of how the user data is stored for this particular system. The "reservations.txt" file shows samples of how the reservation data is stored. 

In the code folder, there are three files and one folder. The "TheaterReservationTerminal.java" file contains the main function for the entire reservation system.
